# Pokemon-Visual-Analysis
I analyze the Pokemon universe. 

In particular, I utilize Tableau to visually explore the relationships among the information. This was more or less a practice exercise for fun; however,
I used advanced concepts like calculated fields and various formatting procedures that are directly transferrable to a more professional setting. 

Please, refer to the Tableau link provided in the Repository. Moreover, I provided a Word file as a write-up to explain my thought process, 
my visualizations & analysis to a general audience, and my motivations for the analysis as a whole.
